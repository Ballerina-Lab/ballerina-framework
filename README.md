## 🧠 What is BALLERINA?

BALLERINA is a structured cognition framework built to enhance AI reasoning by integrating sociological learning theory with dynamic symbolic logic. Where most language models rely on statistical prediction, BALLERINA adds context, justification filtering, and long-form coherence—making her reasoning more human-aligned and more transparent.

This repository contains the public-facing documentation, sample outputs, and theoretical foundations of the framework. The core architecture itself is **not** included, but the structure here showcases how BALLERINA operates, adapts, and out-reasons standard LLMs.

## 📁 Core Documents

### 📄 Theory + System Architecture

- 🔹 [ballerina_white_paper.pdf](./ballerina_white_paper.pdf)  
  The public-facing white paper describing BALLERINA’s core architecture, VeilGuard security layer, token efficiency model, and structural reasoning design.

- 🔹 [cognitive_convergence.pdf](./cognitive_convergence.pdf)  
  Theoretical paper outlining the interdisciplinary foundations of BALLERINA—grounded in predictive coding, Bayesian reasoning, social learning theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Techniques of Neutralization.

- 🔹 [ballerina_portfolio_v1.pdf](./ballerina_portfolio_v1.pdf)  Coming soon!
  Internal-use artifact documenting BALLERINA’s live deployments, strategic application areas, licensing tiers, and toolchain maturity. Designed for collaborators, labs, and research groups evaluating structured reasoning frameworks.

### 🧪 Demos + Applied Reasoning

- 🔹 [abysskin_demo_session.pdf](./abysskin_demo_session.pdf)  
  A live symbolic reasoning session generated from minimal input, demonstrating BALLERINA’s capacity for structured innovation. Originally created under Project ABYSSKIN (speculative bioadaptive pressure suit design).

- 🔹 [symbiospin_demo_proposal.pdf](./symbiospin_demo_proposal.pdf)  
  A demonstration of BALLERINA’s ability to generate coherent, multi-phase biomedical R&D designs using symbolic reasoning, without access to domain-specific fine-tuning.

## 🔒 Licensing & Use

This repository contains public-facing materials and a live demo of the BALLERINA framework. You are welcome to explore, interact with, and test BALLERINA’s cognitive outputs—including for professional or research use—within the provided environments.

However, the underlying architecture, model structure, and reasoning framework remain proprietary. BALLERINA may not be reproduced, reverse-engineered, adapted, or deployed outside this demo environment without express written permission from Dr. Allison Timbs.

**TL;DR:** Use the demo as much as you like. Just don’t copy the brain.
