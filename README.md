## 🧠 What is BALLERINA?

BALLERINA is a structured cognition framework built to enhance AI reasoning by integrating sociological learning theory with dynamic symbolic logic. Where most language models rely on statistical prediction, BALLERINA adds context, justification filtering, and long-form coherence—making her reasoning more human-aligned and more transparent.

This repository contains the public-facing documentation, sample outputs, and theoretical foundations of the framework. The core architecture itself is **not** included, but the structure here showcases how BALLERINA operates, adapts, and out-reasons standard LLMs.

## 📁 Core Documents

### 🔹 `ballerina_white_paper.pdf`
The public-facing white paper describing BALLERINA’s core architecture, VeilGuard security layer, token efficiency model, and structural reasoning design.

### 🔹 `cognitive_convergence.pdf`
Theoretical paper outlining the interdisciplinary foundations of BALLERINA—grounded in predictive coding, Bayesian reasoning, social learning theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Techniques of Neutralization.

### 🔹 `abysskin_demo_session.pdf`
A live symbolic reasoning session generated from minimal input, demonstrating BALLERINA’s capacity for structured innovation. Originally created under Project ABYSSKIN (speculative bioadaptive pressure suit design).

### 🔹 `portfolio_paper_draft.pdf` *(coming soon)*
A strategic deployment and positioning document focused on real-world application, licensing, and system integration opportunities.
